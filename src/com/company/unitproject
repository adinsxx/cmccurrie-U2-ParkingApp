//
//The fee charged for parked vehicles is based on a $5.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
//After that there is an additional $1.00 per hour charge for each hour or part of an hour parked.
//The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $15.00. Assume that no vehicle parks for longer than 24 hours.
//Lost tickets have a $25.00 fee.
//
//The application needs to store all of the tickets in a file.
//When the application is opened, that file needs to load all of the tickets in a collection.
//
//Input
//For input, create a class that emulates a machine that has one button, Check/In.
//And a second machine that you submit your ticket to.
//For the Check/In, the start time should be created by a class that randomly creates a time between 7am and noon.  This class should easily be replaced with a class that would access the real time.  (But that would be harder to test)
//
//The second Machine should produce the bill a check-out time between 1pm and 11pm should randomly be created.
//Output
//Once the ticket is submitted, a bill is produced.
//Once “Close Garage” is selected, a summary of activity to date is produced.
